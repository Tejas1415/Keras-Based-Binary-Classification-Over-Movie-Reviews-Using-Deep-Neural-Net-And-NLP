### Keras-based-Binary-Classification-over-Movie-Reviews-using-Neural-Net-and-NLP

Keras has an IMDB movie review dataset which is initially loaded. To reduce the computational cost the most common 10k words are used to learn if the words indicate a good or a bad movie review 0/1 - MAP Classification.

These reviews/words are generally encoded through different values using dictionaries. These reviews can be decoded to a comprehensible manner by running a small piece of code as shown in the uploaded .py file.

The code was developed with reference to an example code in the book "Deep learning with Python" with some improvisations and comprehensible conversions of the code. 

The code is well commented and self-evident.
